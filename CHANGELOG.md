[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Unit state machine with a checked transition table, and a ready-queue scheduler with skip-downstream, `--fail-fast` and stop requests (not wired to the CLI yet).
- Thread executor and a simulated executor for tests; `unit.queued`, `unit.skipped` and `unit.cancelled` event payloads.
- ADR-0020, the execution model for 0.2.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04

First functional release: configuration, layered validation, the dependency graph, selectors,
the plan and manifest, the event bus and the CLI. Running plans comes in 0.2.

### Added

- Diagnostics package with the full error-code catalog (active and reserved codes), text and JSON rendering.
- YAML loader with YAML 1.2 core scalars, source marks, duplicate-key detection, merge keys and an alias expansion limit (ADR-0019).
- `${env:...}` and `${var:...}` interpolation, and a secret-like field check (PLS104).
- Pydantic configuration models for `pipeloom.yml`, model files and `_defaults.yml`, with schema errors mapped to file locations and did-you-mean hints.
- `pipeloom validate` with `--project-dir` (`PIPELOOM_PROJECT_DIR`), `--vars` and `--warn-error`; exit codes 0, 1, 2 and 130.
- Python API: `pipeloom.api.Project` and `ProjectOptions`; `pipeloom.platform` clock and identity seams.
- Plugin system: `pipeloom.plugins` with `PluginSpec`, `PluginRegistry`, `API_VERSION` and `check_api`; entry-point discovery that reads metadata only, `--plugin module:attr`, `PIPELOOM_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`, and codes PLU001 to PLU003 (ADR-0017).
- Built-in plugins from a lazy in-code table: `memory` engine and catalog, `none`, `prefix` and `per_user` naming, `env` secret provider, and the `filesystem` catalog spec (implementation in 0.2).
- Engine contracts: `pipeloom.engine` types and protocols, `RuntimeContext`, and `pipeloom.testing.memory` (MemoryEngine and MemoryCatalog on sqlite3).
- Target binding: `--target` (`PIPELOOM_TARGET`), `default_target`, runtime merge and plugin option validation, with codes PLR204 and PLR207. `Project.bind()` in the API.
- `pipeloom schema export` writes JSON Schemas for `pipeloom.yml`, model files and `_defaults.yml`, with plugin options as `oneOf` branches.
- `pipeloom plugins list` with `--group`, `--output`, `--check` and `--plugin`.
- Model settings resolution: `_defaults.yml` cascades from the model's folder up to its model_paths root, then `defaults.models`; mappings merge deeply, lists replace and `tags` is a deduplicated union. Unique ids `model.<project>.<name>` and `source.<project>.<name>`.
- L2 reference checks (PLR201, PLR202, PLR203, PLR205) with did-you-mean hints.
- Dependency graph with deterministic topological order, depth-limited ancestors and descendants, and cycle detection (PLG301, PLG302).
- Selector engine: space union, comma intersection, `N+` and `+N` graph operators, and the `name`, `tag`, `path` and `materialized` methods (PLG303 to PLG305).
- `Project.resolve()` in the API runs load, bind, resolve, L2 and graph.
- `pipeloom ls` (`--output text|json`) and `pipeloom graph` (`--output text|dot|mermaid|json`), both with repeatable `-s/--select` and `--exclude`. A malformed selector (PLG304, PLG305) exits 2; a selector that matches nothing (PLG303) is a warning.
- Typed events (`pipeloom.event/1`) and a synchronous event bus with failure budgets, redaction and context-manager close; `console`, `jsonl` and buffered sinks; code PLE401 (ADR-0018).
- `--log-format text|json` (`PIPELOOM_LOG_FORMAT`) on every command; `console` and `jsonl` sinks configurable under `events.sinks`.
- `pipeloom.testing.RecordingSink` and `FakeClock`.
- Plan model (`pipeloom.plan`): frozen `Plan`, `PlanNode`, `ExecutionUnit`; one unit per non-ephemeral model with its inlined ephemeral ancestors, identical for both boundaries; target relations from the bound naming strategy.
- Manifest `pipeloom.manifest/1` with `plan_hash` and per-node checksums (CRLF read as LF), `write_manifest`, `read_manifest` and `compute_plan_hash`.
- L4 plan semantics (PLP401 to PLP408), L5 capability checks read from the engine spec without importing it (PLC501, PLC502, PLC504 to PLC508) and L6 static checks of Python callables (PLK601, PLK602, PLK604).
- `Project.validate()` and `Project.compile(selection, boundary)` in the API; `pipeloom validate` now runs L0 to L6.
- `pipeloom compile` with the selection options, `--boundary`, `--out` and `--warn-error`; it emits `plan.compiled` and `artifact.written`.
- Generated docs: error codes, JSON Schemas under `schema/v1/`, the command-line reference, a quickstart and the schema guide.

### Changed

- `pipeloom validate` binds the selected target and checks plugin options, and accepts `--target` and `--plugin`.
- Diagnostics and the run summary go to stderr through the event bus; the summary line now reads `<command> finished in N ms | exit C | E error(s), W warning(s)`. `rich>=13.7` is a new dependency.
- PLS104 matches secret words in key segments (`max_tokens` is no longer flagged) and ignores booleans.
- The CLI needs `click>=8.2`; runtime dependencies now include pydantic and PyYAML.
- CI tests Python 3.11 to 3.14 on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS now that the repository is public.
- PLE401 names the exception type and the sink's configured path instead of the OS error text.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-10-29

0.0.1 was never published: PyPI rejects that file name because an unrelated, deleted project
once used it.

### Added

- Package skeleton with `pipeloom --version` and `__version__`.
- CI, release and docs workflows.
- Apache-2.0 license, contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy and governance.
